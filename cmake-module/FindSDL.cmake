#.rst:
# FindSDL
# -------
#
# Locate SDL library.  Modified by Walter Gray to be compatible with SDL 2.x and
# provide import library pseudo targets. Untested with SDL 1.x.  Then modified
# by Victor Dods to forget SDL 1.x, and only look for SDL 2.x.  This find module
# should be renamed to FindSDL2.cmake -- it is useful to note that the developers
# of SDL have actually changed the name of the library, not just the version.  It
# is actually "SDL2", not "SDL" anymore.  Thus a fully-qualified lib directory name
# would be something like "SDL2-2.0.3", and not "SDL-2.0.3" as one would expect.
#
# Imported Targets
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#   SDL::SDL
#     Basic import target. Use to build an application
#   SDL::Library
#     Advanced import target. Does not link with SDLmain, for use when building libraries
#   SDL::Main
#     Advanced import target. contains only SDLMain.lib
# Result Variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# This module defines the following variables
#
#   SDL_ROOT_DIR
#
#   SDL_FOUND
#
#   SDL_INCLUDE_DIR
#
#   SDL_LIBRARY
#     Where to find SDL.dll/dylib if linking dynamically, or .lib/.a statically
#   SDL_SHARED_LIB
#     Where to find the SDL.dll/dylib if it exists
#   SDL_STATIC_LIB
#     Where to find the SDL.lib/.a if it exists
#   SDL_IMPORT_LIB
#     Where to find SDL.lib (Windows only) if it exists
#   SDL_MAIN_LIBRARY
#     Where to find SDLmain.lib/.a
#   SDL_LINK_TYPE
#     Either STATIC or SHARED depending on if SDL.dll/dylib is found.  If both are available,
#     defaults to SHARED.  Setting this in the cache will attempt to force one or the other
#   SDL_VERSION_STRING
#     A human-readable string containing the version of SDL
#   SDL_LIBRARIES
#     A legacy string - contains a list of all .lib files used by SDL, modified by SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY.
#
# This module responds to the flag:
#
# ::
#
#   SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY
#     If this is defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in because
#     only applications need main().
#     Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
#     module will attempt to locate and set the proper link flags
#     as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY variable.
#
#
#
# Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the
# OS X framework based version.  (Other versions link to -lSDLmain which
# this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
# module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.
#
#
#
# Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your
# configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL
# library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc).  Set
# SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL library, and configure again.
# Similarly, if you see an empty SDL_MAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this
# value as appropriate.  These values are used to generate the final
# SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset, SDL_LIBRARY
# does not get created.
#
#
#
# $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
# ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.  l.e.galup 9-20-02
#
# Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated building
# by using environmental variables and providing a more
# controlled/consistent search behavior.  Added new modifications to
# recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
# Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL
# guidelines.  Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some
# platforms.  Added a search for threads which is needed by some
# platforms.  Added needed compile switches for MinGW.
#
# Modified by Walter Gray. Added code to find SDL2, and create an import
# target.
#
# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to
# override this selection or set the CMake environment
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.
#
# Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
# This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include
# "SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>.  This is done for portability reasons
# because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).
