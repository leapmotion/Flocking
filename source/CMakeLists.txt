# Find and link the Components library and all its dependent libraries, compile flags, and 
# include directories.  In detail, this single call does the following:
# - Finds the Components package and imports all its targets.
# - Links the Components library into the Stub executable target.
# - Finds all external libraries (e.g. FreeImage) that Components depends on and imports all their targets.
# - Links all external libraries into the Stub executable target.
# This is all accomplished via the ComponentsConfig.cmake file (in the root dir of the Components package) which is 
# generated by the `install` target in the Components library.
